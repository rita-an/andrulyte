          This project started with a seminar from the architect duo ‘umschichten’ with a speculative
          approach to architecture and design. Our goal was to build a temporary structure outside the
          school to be an intervention during the annual exhibition. Inspired by the many construction
          sites surrounding the school we decided to rent construction fences to build a big structure.
          The further design was focused on making a recreational space without damaging the fences. I
          wanted to design an opportunity to sit and relax, which then resulted in the sun lounger
          ‘Shiny Stripes’.

          ‘Shiny Stripes’ is a temporary sun lounger made for the installation ‘Spekulatives
          Festivalzentrum ohne Funktion aber mit Lieblingsmaterialien und Hippie Testecke’ for the Rundgang
          2019 at HfG Karlsruhe. It consists out of four wooden beams, which are attached to the construction
          fence, and six silver textile stripes, which are put under tension. The sun lounger is made sturdy
          through multiple windings of the textile aroung the wood. It offers a place to relax for visitors
          and exhausted students during the annual exhibition.

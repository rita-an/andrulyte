          ‘Safe Place’ is part of the ‘News from Nowhere Project’, which consists of nine objects
           stored in a time capsule. Every ten years Rhoda, a girl born in 2017, will receive one of
           them. She will get the carpet ‘Safe Place’ when she is 10 years old. The quilt carpet is
           a playground and offers space for meditation and self-discovery. The symbols depicted on
           it come from the Baltic region and have protective and magical properties.

          Thinking into the future I asked myself the question what would a teenager need in 10-20
          years? Assuming that the amount of electronical devices that connect us to the digital world
          will increase and play a bigger role in the future, I searched for a way to escape the
          overwhelming data flow and to focus on defining oneself. Shifting between the ‘aluminum-hat’
          and curiosity of a child I wanted to create a place, where one can meditate and discover new
          things in a playful way without the need of connection to the outerworld. The carpet ‘Safe Place’
          with its circular shape defines a place for meditation and catches the attention with its colours.
          The combination with a foresight ritual gives the carpet a spiritual meaning and satisfies
          curiosity of a teenager on the search for identity.
